==========================================
YOU SHOULD READ THIS MESSAGE IN YOUR local/
DIRECTORY. config/blueprint ONLY CONTAINS
THE DEFAULT COPY OF THE CONFIGURATION. IT
IS NOT IN USE AS YOU RUN THE SERVER. SO
DON'T EDIT ANY FILES IN config/blueprint.
THX ======================================
 
banner.txt is the file that is shown to
telnet users at login

config.c is currently not being used, really.

config.h is of no interest.

hosts.h lets you specify ip ranges that are
particularely trustworthy or untrustworthy.

init.ls contains the list of classes that
will be compiled at boot-time. it is mostly
useful for debugging, as in a healthy
system any required class can be compiled
at the moment it is used for the first time.
so for production use this is kept to the
bare minimum. only the parts of psyced you
are actually using will be loaded.

local.h hosts your personal tunings to the
psyced system.

path.h lets you rearrange the directories
where the code for the protocol implementations
reside. you don't need to do that normally.

ports.h is generated by the installation
procedure and contains the port numbers you
chose for the services you want to use.

psyconf.h is also generated that way by the
psyconf utility. it contains the settings
from psyced.ini in a form pleasant for LPC.
