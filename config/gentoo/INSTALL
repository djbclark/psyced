================ AUTOMATED PORTAGE INSTALLATION =============================

The Makefile in this directory will create a portage overlay for psyclpc and
psyced if necessary, than generate ebuild digests and get you ready for
emerge. All you need to do is type:

	make

If you tried this previously and ran into trouble, you may have to clean out
the 'psyced' and 'psyclpc' subdirectories from your portage overlay before
doing make, so it starts anew. You can do:

	make new

================ SHUBBLETROUTING ============================================

In all above cases you should be done with installation. If anything goes wrong
get in touch with us on psyc://psyced.org/@welcome so we can fix the problem
not only for you, but for everyone who might run into the same problem.

If you're in doubt that the generator files aren't the newest, you can update
them by issueing:

	make up

================ MANUAL INSTALLATION ========================================

We have stopped providing regular ebuild files for manual installation
as nobody is maintaining them. Feel free to step in.

================ WHY STILL LDMUD? ===========================================

We are just leaving it in as there are no newer releases of ldmud and so
this ebuild is still up to date for anyone who needs an ldmud ebuild.
We may however simplify things later and therefore remove it.
