# This Makefile serves the purpose to produce the files ebuild needs to be
# happy. So it is an ebuildbuilder. Targets are: ebuild, Manifest and clean.
#
# 'make' needs to be called in gentoo/config to generate the ebuilds and files
# directory, then ../Makefile will transfer this to portage where 'make' will
# call ebuild to create digests and the Manifest. After that you are ready to
# emerge. From nothing. fischerspooner rocks.	-lynX
