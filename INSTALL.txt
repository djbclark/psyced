Installing the psycMUVE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're very proud to see you are about to install a psycMUVE!

(Windows System)
    You received this in form of an executable. By executing it you
    will be prompted some questions, then sent to a web-based
    configuration interface. So essentially you don't need any help here.
    Please move directly on to the FIRSTSTEPS document once you have
    done the installation.
        [1]http://muve.pages.de/FIRSTSTEPS

(Linux or Unix System)
    In a nutshell, all you have to do is execute './install.sh' and go from
    there. It will tell you to download an LDMUD driver from
        [2]http://muve.pages.de/ldmud
    then compile and configure it with you interactively. So you don't need
    to know anything more now, but if you want more information, read on.

(Questions and Answers)
    Don't be afraid to come into our developer chatroom and interact with
    us as you go along. We have designed the installation to be totally
    simple and beginner friendly. If you're not experiencing it as such,
    something has gone wrong. Don't try to figure it out alone, talk to us.
    And.. please be patient with our slow response times.

0. System Requirements
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can skip this if you think you have a sanely configured unix system.

   The following requirements exist for building psycMUVE and ldmud:

   o  Disk Space:

      Make sure you have approximately 7 MB of temporary free disk space
      available.  After installation psycMUVE occupies approximately 3 MB of
      disk space (the current required disk space depends on the amount of
      users, logs etc).

   o  ANSI-C Compiler:

      Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
      (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended.
      You can find the homepage of GNU at [6]http://www.gnu.org/. GCC
      binaries for Solaris can be loaded from [7]http://www.sunfreeware.com/.

   o  POSIX YACC compliant grammar compiler

      You probably have either bison or yacc installed, otherwise do the
      appropriate emerge or whatever software installation.

   o  Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]

      The distribution includes some perl scripts that may or may not
      be useful.


1. How to compile an LPC driver manually
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can skip this part if you want to let the installation mechanism
   do it for you. To be honest, the danger of us not giving you enough
   information for you to get it done right is lessened if you let the
   process do it.

   [8]http://lpc.pages.de will direct you to the current download areas for
   a PSYC-enabled LPC driver, like currently LDMUD. The LDMUD driver uses
   a standard autoconfiguration system which on most systems does all the
   work for you (for exceptions see below). That's how install.sh can do it
   just like that.

   To prepare the compilation, enter the src directory of LDMUD and execute
   the 'psycmuve' script located in '[9]world/drivers/ldmud/patches/psycmuve'.
   within the src/settings directory of LDMUD, or -even better- use
   the maybe more up to date 'psycmuve' file in the patches directory
   of world/drivers/ldmud. The default target directory is /opt/psycmuve -
   please edit the script if you need a different path.

   After configuration is finished, you may want to modify the Makefile
   to fine tune those parameters which are not covered by the configuration.
   (like maybe change 'INSTALL=./install.sh -c' to 'INSTALL=./install.sh')
   But there is generally no need to do anything really.

   The compilation is done using make. Following targets are implemented:

     <none>:        compile the driver
     install:       compile the driver and install it in ${bindir}
     utils:         compile the utilities, especially the ERQ daemon
     install-utils: compile and install the utilities in ${bindir}

   For more details feel free to read the LDMUD INSTALL file.


2. Okay, let's install it!
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To install psycMUVE, execute the './install.sh' script from within
   the distribution directory. On some systems you may have to use a
   different shell, like 'ksh install.sh' or 'bash install.sh'.

   You will be asked some configuration questions. When done, it will
   create several files for you and transfer the content of the psycMUVE
   distribution to the target directory you specified interactively.
   Depending on your userid (root or other) you will be given
   /opt/psycmuve or ~/psycmuve as defaults for installation. We
   continue this documentation assuming you picked the root defaults.

   Start psycMUVE:
        /opt/psycmuve/bin/psycmuve

   Test it:
        telnet localhost 2000
    or
        irc <nick> localhost


3. Configuring psycMUVE
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    We have a very very useful web-based configuration tool.
    The installation process will direct you to it. If you want to
    activate it manually, edit local/local.h and add the following
    line: '#define WEB_CONFIGURE' - As you restart the MUVE you will
    be able to use it at [10]http://localhost:44444/net/http/configure

    Careful who else may have access to the localhost address.
    If in doubt, simply disable WEB_CONFIGURE after use.

    Should you need to access the configuration tool from a remote host,
    using a tunneling technology like ssh is probably the safest approach.
    If that is not an option you need to put the IP number of your browsing
    client (or an abbreviation of it, like "127.0.0." with a trailing dot)
    into the local/hosts.h file in your configuration directory.
    The syntax is something like:

        #define ENABLE_HOSTS "192.168.0.1"

    If the IP number is only dynamic, it is certainly a good idea to
    remove that entry after web configuration is complete.


4. Troubleshooting
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   LDMUD will compile TLS in, even if you told install.sh not to use it.
   This allows you to change your mind later on and shouldn't be a problem,
   but if it is, edit src/config.h to #undef USE_TLS and redo the compilation.

   There is a problem specific to the LDMUD 3.3.610 version, when it comes to
   compilation: It doesn't set the #define USE_TLS properly in config.h even
   if the configure settings file tells it to. Please edit src/config.h
   accordingly and recompile. Other than that 610 is very stable and a good
   choice!

   You may also have to add the --tls-key options into the commandline
   in bin/psycmuve. Just look into it and you'll see what I mean.

   If you still encounter problems, please read (Questions and Answers)
   at the beginning of this document.


5. Conclusion
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You can now move on to the FIRSTSTEPS document.
    Here's the online version, but you have one on your harddisk too.
