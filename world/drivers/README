There is no psyclpc directory! Because psyclpc is a
derivate of LDMUD and thus uses the ldmud/ subdirectory.

We are working to make psyced work with pike.
Then again. Can't find the time.

psyced can run with amylaar up to a certain point.
Not to be recommended.

MudOS and Nemesis drivers are currently not doing their job,
but you can give it a try to work on it.
