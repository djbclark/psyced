    This program is also available under different license from
    Carlo von Loesch and symlynX. To this purpose all copyright
    owners until 2010 grant Carlo von Loesch and symlynX the right
    to use and license this program in whatever suitable way.

    By the act of submitting code to the psyced maintainers you guarantee
    that you are either the author and copyright owner of the contribution
    you are making, or that you have a license to use said contribution in
    a way compatible with our licenses. If you fail to do so, you
    remain the sole responsible for your actions; no part of the
    responsibility will be transferred to symlynX.

    This means, for example, that you cannot contribute code elements
    which stem from an other GPL project, as this would not comply with
    the MIT license requirement after 2010.

    You can however keep this kind of modifications to yourself, or
    publish your own GPL licensed fork of this software, or - in agreement
    with us - add optional parts to this software clearly marked as not
    adhering to this license.
